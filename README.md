HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN BIRYANI – 3 MAIN STEPS
I believe this recipe is as easy as an authentic biryani recipe can be – no superfluous or tedious steps that don’t contribute to big flavor. You’ll find that while it takes time, most of it is passive cooking time. And the end result is quite rewarding and impressive. These are 3 parts to making chicken biryani:

Prepare the chicken curry.
Prepare the biryani masala (or use store-bought) and marinate the chicken.

Cook the chicken curry. While it’s cooking over low heat, prepare the rice.
